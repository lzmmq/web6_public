&lt;li>During my academic journey, I have had the privilege of contributing to cutting-edge research projects under the guidance of Dr. Ian Flood. My work includes developing advanced computational models and leveraging machine learning techniques for real-world applications. I designed a transient pressure acoustic simulation neural network (NN) by integrating high-resolution simulation data from COMSOL Multiphysics, creating coarse-grained models to enhance performance while maintaining precision. Additionally, I developed an LSTM-based recurrent neural network (RNN) for analyzing bending moment data in weigh-in-motion systems, surpassing traditional machine learning approaches in accuracy and robustness. These experiences have honed my expertise in simulation modeling, data analysis, and the application of neural networks to solve complex engineering challenges.&lt;/li>
